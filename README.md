# Facail-Keypoints-Detection

Different machine learning algorithms for facial key-points detection 

Five different Neural Networks' architectures were used. 2 were Fully-Connected NNs while 3 were Convulutional NNs. 

The complete docummentation of this project can be found here.

An example of how the best used algorithm (LeNet-5) works is presented below, where the algorithm found every key-point on my face.
