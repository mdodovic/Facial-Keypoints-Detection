# Facail-Keypoints-Detection

Different machine learning algorithms for facial key-point detection 

Five different Neural Networks' architectures were used. 2 were Fully-Connected NNs while 3 were Convolutional NNs. 

The complete documentation of this project can be found here.

An example of how the algorithm with the highest performances trained in this project (LeNet-5) works below, where the algorithm found every key point on my face.
