# Facail-Keypoints-Detection

Different machine learning algorithms for facial key-point detection. Five different Neural Networks' architectures were used. 2 were Fully-Connected Neural Networks while 3 were Convolutional Neural Networks. 

The dataset used for this project is the [Facial Keypoints Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 7049 training images and 1783 test images. Each image has 96x96 pixels and 15 facial keypoints. 

This work, with title **Comparison of Deep Learning Algorithms for Facial Keypoints Detection** is presented on the International Conference on Information Society and Technology in the March 2023. The full paper is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-50755-7_12).
